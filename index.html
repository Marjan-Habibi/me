            <h1>Hi! I‚Äôm Marjan üòé‚úåÔ∏è</h1>
            <p>A girl who‚Äôs always chasing new things to learn‚Äîfrom coding and web design to philosophy and writing. Most of the time you‚Äôll find me with a book in my hand or writing something down, but I also love playing around with tech and programming.
                I‚Äôm not the type who wants to follow just one path‚ÄîI dream of being both a doctor and a writer, working with people‚Äôs minds and their hearts at the same time. üå±
                
                I see life as an adventure‚Äîfull of twists, challenges, and surprises. And honestly, that‚Äôs what makes it beautiful. ‚ú®</p>

            <h1>I‚Äôm Marjan ‚ú® A girl who loves learning and creativity.</h1>
            <p>I have a passion for calligraphy, shaping words beautifully on paper. Photography is my way of capturing moments that no words could ever describe. Writing is another world for me, and right now I‚Äôm working on my very first book, where my stories and experiences come to life.
                
                On the other hand, coding and web design are like a bridge between imagination and reality‚Äîwhere I can turn my ideas into something digital and alive. By joining different educational and leadership programs, I‚Äôve also gained skills in teamwork, women empowerment, and communication.
                
                For me, life is a journey full of discoveries and creations‚Äîwhether through a pen, a camera, or a line of code. üå±üì∏üíª‚úçÔ∏è</p>

            <p>This morning, the air was cold and dark,
                until the afternoon, when the sun returned and brightened the sky.
                Yet, my heart grew heavy.
                
                Through the window, the sunlight looked dazzling.
                I opened the door and stepped onto the balcony.
                I stood close to the wall, gazing at the blue sky and the radiant sun.
                Then, the doves began their fearless dance in the air.
                The sound of their wings touched my heart.
                
                The sun shone brighter than the days before,
                its light blurring my eyes.
                As I watched the flight of the doves,
                a deep sense of servitude overwhelmed me......</p>
